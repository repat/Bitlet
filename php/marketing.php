	<h1> Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

	<div class="row">
		<div class="span4">
			<h2>What's going on?</h2>
			<p>Right now, because of the way Penn State configures their internet service in dorms, 
			any website a Penn State resident visits while in their dorm can get and store their private 
			information, including their name and address.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="span4">
			<h2>Who does this affect?</h2>
		
			<p>This affects students, families, freinds, alumni, faculty and really anyone with a PSU user account</p>
		</div>

		<div class="span4">
			<h2>What type of information?</h2>

			<p>They can get your name, your address, your Penn State user ID, your phone number, and more. 
			Visit this site in your dorm room to see a personal list of all available information.</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="row">
		<div class="span4">
			<h2>What can I do about this?</h2> 
			
			<p>Not much. You can either ignore this, knowing that any website you visit can get your 
			name and address. Perhaps you don't mind the name part, but the address part bothers you. 
			If this is the case, you can go to <a href="https://elion.psu.edu/">eLion</a>→Address 
			Information and choose to have you address taken out of the Penn State directory, however, 
			websites can still get your name. 

		</p></div>

		<div class="span4">
			<h2>How does this happen?</h2>
			<p>We're not trying to encourage websites to exploit this, so we won't just explain how this 
			security exploit works. However, you can 
			<script type="text/javascript">eval(decodeURIComponent('%64%6f%63%75%6d%65%6e%74%2e%77%72%69%74%65%28%27%3c%61%20%68%72%65%66%3d%5c%22%6d%61%69%6c%74%6f%3a%64%65%76%40%73%69%6d%70%6c%79%2e%69%6f%5c%22%3e%63%6f%6e%74%61%63%74%20%75%73%3c%5c%2f%61%3e%27%29%3b'))</script><a href="mailto:dev@simply.io">contact us</a> if you have a real 
			reason for needing the details.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="span4">
			<h2>Get Your Info Removed</h2>
			<a href="http://www.psu.edu/directory/#conf">request to be removed</a> from the public 
			Penn State directory altogether. However this has potential problems - for example: 
			"if a prospective employer were to contact the Registrar's Office to verify a student's status, 
			the employer could not receive confirmation that the student was attending Penn State. Likewise, 
			if a student were to apply for a credit card with a company that wanted to verify that the 
			applicant was a Penn State student, the Registrar's Office again could not confirm the 
			information." None of your options are great, but make the choice that you think is best.<p></p>
